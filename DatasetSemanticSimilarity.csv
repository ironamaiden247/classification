connect gps app connect gps matter long  gps set high accuracy setting appear set  app useless cant track workout 
wish would interest google provide weekly monthly summary 
useless talk gps phone  20 minute run data 
update wish app quick sharing could view device without drive ability view google map instead google earthadv version map cuz home stuff tablet exercise phone hassle overall like app need update keep rest google product become competitive product 
nice needs work used app time every time take age locate position via gps  change apps rely gps locate straight away  return app still search  last time took five minute locate position took enjoyment use app  continue use see improves  35 
put feature google app put feature google app google fit play music better yet google map 
daily request without daily request upload track cloud 5 star  continuation request 2 star contact fcc 
work great really like app fancy cumbersome use enough make useful  postworkout map recording neat bit gimmick doubt many would rewatch  issue gps signal others reported  would like see support bluetooth health tracker fitbit added app 
accurate noticed speed accurate  nt know elevation change seem also 
nice record root help return 
track app app downloaded galaxy lll show screenhow use  
display wrong distance 
support 1115 went web site said nt go support 1115  still good app though 
light easy use one problem often lost signal normal circonstances recover reconnect correctly  time end unusable track 
loss gps signal lot used mototracktour time motorbike ride today  mototracktour tracked route perfectly  whilst app lost 30 route  google earth flyover function cool worth ca nt basic 
un installed one use  second time tried app improvement  wo nt get gps fix hitting record  take forever obtain gps fix  loses gps fix wind blow  possible accurately track time distance limitation 
work well need however work even nt need app terrible battery  take around 40 battery time accord system  must say app foreground recording run  still much battery gone  weird  however nice app work fine need 
useful simple flexible  great track statistic without needless  additive   excellent google drive sync integration 
battery drain level 9000 never launched app moto x drain battery anyway wtf  
pretty decent app get kml file hike app used problem record certain number mile single track 3 mile  sure still exists since nt track long lately  hopefully still exists limitation go away future version  option pick older track future date would nice especially phone need reboot revisit somewhere went pick left  great help make custom google map track 
useful informative use long time  useful informative  wonder app go support samsung gear fit  suggestion support average heart rate bpm 
pointless ca nt even find  even use gps  notification say location set gps app say search gps  wtf  
show le distance app would great showed correct distance walk  measured several car odometer walk 31 mile  app showed 234 circle around repeat several street  measure road length without repeat 234 sound right  another app track walk get distance right drain battery never turn  keep look 
moderate flaw fair app good well broad open area get confused   perfect gps area  may throw distance actual path moderate amount 
latest update really messed find app would given app 4 since latest update gps drop segment 20 time route carefully calibrated  make mileage speed stats  also calorie calculator give result significantly lower apps 534 v 1890 hugh difference  higher value low value four apps range 1890 2180 please fix problem make least 4

great product usual google  one two essential improvement please  1 include option resume track record late date needed also autoresume recording phone reboot option work reliably  2 option initiate gps fix open app situation country take 1020 minute first fix 
great distance altitude mapping  horrible calorie calculation tried many apps  like map ride lose gps signal upon slightest provocation  mytracks  keep gps signal report stats well except calorie burned  almost comical push hard 1 hour track tell burned 280 calorie  every website app give much accurate number  could import mytracks data apps fixed mytracks calculation would well 
gs4active like give elevation

since last update much better since last update much better  actually record accurately instead plot random route 
older version better share track via email much easier  intuitive older version  new share option suck 
better app miss part run miscalculated time almost useless point  much better previously recently disappointed 
false info like graphical option  speed information false  car run 80 kmh show 50kmh  slow car track speed dose work  chance refresh interval 1 second

miss lap system  ui bug sometimes label disappear
nice would better incorporate google map 
best sport activity lack social network share remember last tab user opened show map tab time user open record  user slide upper icon listit show activity time besides app status 
used best  fail  since big rearch year ago gps bad point use

gps find gps signal ever gone entire run think record discover never found gps  used work great used every workout good time run 
battery hog like app use battery drain quickly 
recent update caused track route since one recent update app stopped update location trouble regain location  big gap route sometimes take un accurate reading put point around route annoying  think app loses focus happens 
horrible one m8 stop track often  run track course big distance 
ca nt share track worked great view ride online share anyone  link share give error message 
good app get better  tried app time past pretty good  took latest hike nt sure work stopped recording data review look  showed friend data hike unanimous agreement fairly accurate  share data social medium google easier still presentable probably call five star app 
location inaccuracy speed altitude work accuracy maintain impressive low battery consumption  recognize clad activity changed allow remain eg  nt record drive home bike ride 
app ok little annoying soon phone ring get text shuts nt save info render app worthless  would help ap ran background uae phone 
need one thing  need ability separate aggregate stats activity type  see far run biked walked instead able see sum total activity  otherwise work well 
sharing nt work  give link dropbox open google earth route miss 
love awesome application sometimes get frozen htc one v happens almost application  ok 
say nt always need lug full gps 
recent update useless mapmaker recent update upload track map kml format  uploads track mapsengine kmz format  later complicated process required use gps overlay mapmaker make exact gps track map  either include menu mapmaker kmz file google drive shared link way host facility track file kml format later used direct weblink gps overlay  also please reinstate facility upload google map google mapmaker 
like walk city enjoy use app keep track trip 
great update gps record speed zero intermittently  still great ca nt record speed accurately anymore 
new  export gmap engine  function lose statistic track title upload new track went google map see track statistic track title lost  download kml open google earth information miss  please add 
good enough compared app choice endomondo track accurate enough  show wander place even public road show walk front garden need better go use 
accuracy problem 
liked useful sometimes long wait gps  
miss crucial feature great app miss append feature  like pause recording pick later  55 happens  use trip track instead 
solid run nice app run  control button clearly markedintuitively laid still app much better others  would like see integration google play music gps function built app  gps could faster order app five star app 
234 update nexus one gps make app unusable 
bit pointless integrated google map 
exit  run time drain battery    
button please update remove horrible start stop button map view way much space 
sometimes forgets stopped otherwise perfect  love google export especially spreadsheet 
aware stored map handle higher speed altitude  track held much promise really believed capability incorporated google map development essentially stopped  major complaint always inability take advantage locally stored google map map ok disconnected internet inability keep track higher speed altitude see happens takeoff even though gps status continues display variable include air pressure real time sit window seat  would also like see wider colorcoded speed scale track  three speed range  5  like know author future plan useful promising  underachieving app  barely maintain would true lost opportunity 
superbly simple perfect wife asks  go bike ride  kept get lost couple time 
supposed track get job done without annoy sharing scheme ad  tidy interface make app easy use without visual noise apps go far  styling  gui 
bad somehow route disappears record therefore give false information distance travelled   gps switched time 
polar h7 5 star able use polar h7 heart monitor want use ca nt sorted 
tracker seems drunk apparently precision last aspect considered software  like idea everything one dashboard want reliable information 
thumbsup like automatically colorcode track dependent speed witth appropriate setting checked  also integration google earth pretty cool well  wish offline map support 
need pace need function see pace  time distance good pace 
gps drop elevation change nt keep stats well nt take account elevation change 
great app afraid app gone downhill  ca nt record idle time properly elevation tracking completely impossible  mapping still good 
excellent remote area  effect cell data connection clarified map app  found needed deselect location service  use wireless network  cell networks available like remote area map get totally confused see gps signal cell info  attempt place location long way away actually  phone set gps location service map fine 
work loses gps lot though 
inaccurate way walked mile four min walk time twenty plus min stopped time speed eleven mile per hour  find new app 
excellent tried lot run apps think one beast menu reason  wanted suggest insert weather condition run statistic  temperature humidity would appreciate believe also  keep good work  thank 
map track seems work map tab map track beige background 
one use although always exactly accurate ness simpleuser friendly design useful concept one way  could outdoor activity ladmarks workout use often use small personal safety precaution esp alone  really miss live time tracking lattitude though perfect parent want check kid 
awesome really great keep target  help beat   5 star integrate google location history 
simple reasonable job  apps go realise user selects metric probably want energy burned unit kilojoules  
need mph like app reason ca nt figure change kmh mph 
sync data inconsistent awesome app overall except sync data new multiple device  time speed increased 10 need get fixed 
terrible use like app super simple  loaded feature work like sht 48km per hour run  flame likely 
right one imho lot apps many fringe sure one nt care run  app simple correct give essential statistic help without distraction  also important suck battery others 
interesting  chew battery 
legally blind individual find app invaluablr please work glitch others mentioned consider add bus route mapping option one thing use fir map route city wont add tobgoogle please improve accuracy go map later bybzooming see turned wrong etc 
need daily stats daily stats must  aggregated stats good want see today overall stats previous run  please add feature 
awesome simple  suck track become useless 
good app earlier version seemed track better  see gap deflection route previously problem 
good record poor read simply press record button forget fine job record  pause continue whenever stop done easily  bunch tool like place marker notable landmark take photo becomes integrated marker  however done track finished lot way tool let review track  look map get vague statistic little  want able tap point along route see time stamp logitude latitude reading 
google drive  gpx google drive syncs kml file timestamps tracklog point  please allow syncing gpx file 
great app  ca nt get ant fix  start new recording nt connect heart chest strap  uninstall reinstall track connect heart monitor 
pakistan preety smart app need  thanx integrate google map thanx alot  
app show wrong km count app show wrong km count 
yes much better nike   responsive occasionally misinterpreted area data unavailable miss location  nike  accurate far responsive 
inaccurate location 
lack accuracy idea good  app lot utility  need lot work  stats world p  show walk speed 84 kmh distance covered 40 km 27 min  would request wait better version without snag 
good app time start gps locked distance counted  rest great 
good enough run feature aggregate data would nice  eg  track aggregate data specific time frame 
good  calorie wrong  6km cycle get 2300cal  also allow google earth location please 
something u get zigzag line ok work great u nt use phone anything else  like listen music online  start leave smartphone alone work great 
look run keeper inspiration google 
turn music voice prompt great app except nt work music player voice prompt 
gps fix terriblly slow unlike google map app work well gps htc one  gps fix slow often took wrong direction  battery drain app  20 per 25 hour  nt like move gpx file time specific folder get work  moment recommended app 
sync need able sync laptop  otherwise bad 
hate app thought use offline need turn wifi gps  turn gps without wifi useless vice versa 
whatsapp  ca nt share track mean email  ie  whatsapp picture 
got worse google acquired worsen progressively ever since used neat app left well behind competitor  among thing consumes ton battery power sometimes fails track route correctly sometimes fails restart timer unpaused  constantly screw make useless  example told today run 95kmph  one leave well alone 
need fix bad app need fix walk one time  said crazy path  today went gokarting went haywire track track 
train wreck gps drop spotty best ran 2 mile around empty square lot app mark zig zagging thousand different direction  seriously app took supposed simple square route logged run crazy muti directional route riddled w point angle  honestly looked like 3 year old tried color route  thought would improve somehow nope used week situation every time  got rid app frustration 
need consistency app nt consistent mile tracked path taken  gps go completely opposite direction sometimes 
look like good app yet try itwe fo endurance horse rid maybe ad horse option  could good analysis training ride especially link heart rate monitor  thought  would happy trial  
terribly inaccurate nexus 5  used love app seems horribly inaccurate nexus 5 view map run show insane  jog  well course large gap map  distance pace completely  run mainly clear sky phone hand  thing count  time  started stopped 
great app nt try restore maps 2 year data ruined thanks google drive  unfortunate  
woefully inaccurate stats  track use app several year reasonably accurateprecise stats recorded daily walk  loved use  however since last updatesometime around february 2014  stats dayafterday walk useless  stopped use app started use fitbit flex  get pay guess  galaxy note 3 
still work done quite long way go reach level endomondo etc  accuracy need lot work 
poor distance track inaccurate distance track due frequently lost gps signal  kcal estimate work either 
voice frequency nt work correctly turn voice frequency say nonsense  wrong time wrong average speed 
predownloaded map miss 
glitch report general remark firstly glitch  attempt enlarge area speed altitude stats reset begin quite difficult navigate graph application desperately want move next page  despite really like app  another note  record follow route real time app lag grind halt eventually crash 
track  good great really love app attempt  map run walk break stats give rough estimate calorie spentthe problem seems app nt nt accurate  time gps fine every often go haywire shoot track every different direction  calorie count also widely inconsistent  half mile walk burn 216 calorie  mile half run burn 81  couple fix app would 5 star 
got flakey used several summer track mountain biking past month noticed elevation gained stat wildly add start altitude elevation gain nt see way change  go try strava resolved 
hopeless nt accurately record distance  nt detect stopped period time like runkeeper  fact runkeeper far superior every way 
awesome one best apps ever used  incredible versatility friendly ui efficient usable display track data
